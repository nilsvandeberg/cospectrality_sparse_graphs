# cospectrality_sparse_graphs
Code for experimental results in section 4 of 'Are sparse graphs typically determined by their spectrum?'.

You can run the notebook for any density and order if you adapt the 'n = 50' line and the 'deglist = [1.2, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 5]' line.
Any positive output indicates that the graph is determined by its R-spectrum. A zero indicates that the graph has a cospectral mate. A -1 means that the graph in uncontrollable and any other negative value means that the algorithm was terminated.
